## Understanding The Perceptron Model
<p align="justify">
This repository provides an in-depth exploration of the fundamental steps involved in Rosenblatt's Perceptron Model. The accompanying Python notebook meticulously breaks down the concept of the Perceptron, offering a comprehensive explanation of how it functions. The notebook delves into the underlying theory of the model, walking through each step of the process, from input data handling to the calculation of weighted sums and the application of the step function. By offering detailed insights into the mechanics of the Perceptron, the notebook ensures a clear and fundamental understanding of its role in binary classification tasks, as well as the iterative process that enables it to learn and make decisions based on input data.
